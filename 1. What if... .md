# What if...

What if you were teleported into an alternate reality where sexuality had nothing to do with dating? In fact, in this society, sexuality isn’t even a concept. 

# So Imagine…

… that one perfectly sunny day you are lying in bed with your black-out curtains and thick comforter holding you hostage. You get a text from someone you befriended recently. With your corneas screaming from the sudden white screen, you see they sent you a link to download a dating app called “Twindle.” You tap the link and are then enveloped in a pink glow.
