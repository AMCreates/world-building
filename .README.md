# Why This Experiment?

I had planned on building up a different world for this submission, but I changed my mind at the last second! So while I have not been officially working on this thought experiment for long, I have been thinking about similar ones for years. They mostly stem from wanting to push and explore what romantic love means for different people across many sexualities and identities. Plus, how societal structures impact us in general. 

I’ve always had the mentality that I would fall in love with whoever I was “meant to,” whatever that means. People are people. As I got older, I realized that those things do matter to people and society, and that to an extent, even to myself. 

"Would you still love me if I were a worm?" What a funny question that inspired this entire piece.

I created this world specifically to be a thought experiment for psychological reasons and my own curiosity. It is whacky and full of hypocrisy, contradictions, and the ideals of a crazy man who wants to make his version of a perfect society. It did turn out a little darker than I first intended, but I just went with it.
