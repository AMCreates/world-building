# Planet K3

Society on K3 (Essentially “Earth”) works pretty similarly to how things run in America. People still have jobs, pay taxes, go to school, etc., but there are some differences. The city you materialize into seems clean, busy, and architecturally stunning. one of the most noticeable differences is dating. This world used to be like Earth in nearly every way until  Mr. V created the app “Twindle.” 

Mr. V, a love-obsessed mastermind, was sick and tired of these “fake” ideas of love in society. People cheated, lied, had ulterior motives, didn’t know how to communicate, and were too focused on material things. He thought things had become far too complicated with silly societal constructs (the hypocrisy here lol) like sexuality. He believed that true romance should surpass all and that it was dead. Unless… someone was smart enough to bring it back better than ever.
