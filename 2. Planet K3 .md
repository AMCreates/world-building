# Planet K3

Society on K3 (Essentially a parallel to Earth) works pretty similarly to how things run in America. People still have jobs, pay taxes, go to school, etc., but there are some differences. 

One of the most significant differences is dating. Sexuality is not a concept in this society. Well, just not anymore.

# History

K3 was a war-ridden planet about 200 years before you arrived. 

In the beginning, the planet had burnt through all of its resources and poisoned the planet. Economies collapsed and riots filled the streets. People had to pay for oxygen because the air became unbreathable. Freshwater became scarce and was hoarded by the rich. Small countries were eaten by nearby larger ones. Finally, "The Final War" began.

Humanity was on the brink of collapse. No country or group was winning and nowhere was safe. Everyone was tired and weary from the conflict. Millions of people had died. 

A soldier named Vincent, who had become a little crazy due to the atrocities he had faced, had a vision for the future. He talked and talked, and consequently, the people he talked to did the same. Eventually, he led a revolution to save humanity from itself. Anyone who opposed this vision was killed. This became known as "The Great Rebirth."

Humanity rebuilt itself and slowly began healing the planet. The small pocket of the world that has been revived is called "The Bubble."

Mr. V, a love-obsessed mastermind, was sick and tired of these “fake” ideas of love in society. People cheated, lied, had ulterior motives, didn’t know how to communicate, and were too focused on material things. He thought things had become far too complicated with silly societal constructs (the hypocrisy here lol) like sexuality. He believed that true romance should surpass all and that it was dead. Unless… someone was smart enough to bring it back better than ever.
