# Planet K3

Society on K3 shares many similarities to Earth civilizations. People have jobs, go to school, etc., but there are some differences. 

- There are no distinct races, ethnicities, cultures, or religions.
- Sexuality is not a concept in this society.
- People have jobs to make society run, but money is not required. Everyone is given food, water, shelter, and any medications or medical treatments they need to live. Other items can be obtained by simple communication. If someone wants a new chair, they contact a carpenter.
- People who break rules are investigated by the government. (This has not been developed much yet)

# History

K3 was a war-ridden planet about 200 years before you arrived. 

In the beginning, the planet had burnt through all of its resources and poisoned the planet. Economies collapsed and riots filled the streets. People had to pay for oxygen because the air became unbreathable. Freshwater became scarce and was hoarded by the rich. Small countries were eaten by nearby larger ones. Finally, "The Final War" began.

Humanity was on the brink of collapse. No country or group was winning and nowhere was safe. Everyone was tired and weary from the conflict. Millions of people had died. 

A soldier named Vincent, who had become a bit crazy due to the horrors he had faced, had a vision for the future. This vision was of a united singular society. A world where everyone was equal and free from discrimination. People had everything they needed to survive and the ability to pursue their passions. Children would not be orphaned by war, people could breathe clean air, and humans could learn to love the gentler things in life again. He talked and talked, and consequently, the people he talked to did the same. Eventually, he led a revolution to save humanity from itself. Anyone who opposed this vision was killed. This became known as "The Great Rebirth."

Vincent thought to remold the minds of this new society.
- He banned religion. Such strong devotion to different gods or human institutions, in Vincent's mind, created division. 
- Sexuality became a taboo concept. People were to like who they liked without labeling it. Labels, to Vincent, caused division.
- Gender norms were dismanteled.
- Gender identity was slowly removed. Vincent believed that gender identity was simply an old idea and needed to go. Pronouns allowed would be they/them.
- This society would value loyalty, empathy, and responsible behavior.

Humanity rebuilt itself and slowly began healing the planet. The small pocket of the world that has been revived is called "The Bubble." It is the capital of the world.
