# Planet K3

Society on K3 (Essentially a parallel to Earth) works pretty similarly to how things run in America. People still have jobs, pay taxes, go to school, etc., but there are some differences. 

One of the most significant differences is dating. Sexuality is not a concept in this society. In fact, refusing to date someone purely due to their sex would be seen as discriminatory. 

Mr. V, a love-obsessed mastermind, was sick and tired of these “fake” ideas of love in society. People cheated, lied, had ulterior motives, didn’t know how to communicate, and were too focused on material things. He thought things had become far too complicated with silly societal constructs (the hypocrisy here lol) like sexuality. He believed that true romance should surpass all and that it was dead. Unless… someone was smart enough to bring it back better than ever.
