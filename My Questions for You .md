# What Do You Think?

These are just some things to think about, not necessarily answer.

So you are in this society where things are very different from your reality. You know what gender identity and sexuality are, but they mean nothing to these people. The only way to get home is to use the app for a year and make at least 5 meaningful connections.

Would you take Twindle seriously? 
- You could meet the love of your life!
- If you do not experience romantic attraction, you could make good friends or whatever type of relationship you'd like. That is taken into consideration by the system.

So you make these meaningful connections, even if you hadn't planned it, and a year passes. Now what?

What issues do you think this society might run into?
