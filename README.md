# Why This Experiment?

I had planned to write a different piece for this week, but changed my mind at the last second! So while I have not been officially working on this thought experiment for long, I have been thinking about similar ones for years. They mostly stem from wanting to push and explore what romantic love means for different people across many sexualities and identities. 

One day, I asked my friend, who is very straight, what she would do if her partner magically turned into a woman overnight. Would she still love them? Would she still be attracted to them? Was that really love if she decided to leave that person? She didn’t know, a fair response to such a loaded hypothetical question. While I used the convenience of magic in the question, there are couples in our world who do have to answer it. 

I’ve always had the mentality that I would fall in love with whoever I was “meant to,” whatever that means, and that gender identity and sexual orientation didn’t really matter. As I got older, I realized that those things do matter to people, and that to an extent, even to myself.

This thought experiment is not meant to offend anyone or say that your idea of love is real or not. This stuff is complicated, so let’s talk about it! That being said, please keep any responses to it respectable as well. Thanks!
