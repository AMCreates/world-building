# Why This Experiment?

I had planned on building up a different world for this submission, but I changed my mind at the last second! So while I have not been officially working on this thought experiment for long, I have been thinking about similar ones for years. They mostly stem from wanting to push and explore what romantic love means for different people across many sexualities and identities. Plus, how societal structures impact us in general. 

I’ve always had the mentality that I would fall in love with whoever I was “meant to,” whatever that means, and that gender identity and sexual orientation didn’t really matter. As I got older, I realized that those things do matter to people and society, and that to an extent, even to myself. 

I created this world specifically to be a thought experiment for psychological reasons and my own curiosity. It is whacky and full of hypocrisy and contradictions, but it was fun to make. 

# Disclaimer

This thought experiment is not meant to offend anyone or say that your idea of love is real or not. This stuff is complicated and strange, so let’s talk about it! That being said, please keep any responses to it respectable as well. Thanks!

Now, onto the [experiment](cyan.md)
