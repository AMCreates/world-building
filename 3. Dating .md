# Dating

People are not allowed to just go out and date whomever they please. 
Everyone has the app “Twindle” and it is their only way to have a romantic life. 
The system pairs people with those who it believes they are very compatible with. Then, the user can chat with the selected candidates and they can get to know one another. Compatible matches do not have to commit to each other, but if they do, it is a very serious decision.

Vincent believed that sexuality was a social construct. He thought that true love went beyond the physical and that relationships would be of higher quality if they were formed solely based on personality alone. He knew some structures needed to be kept, so he decided that two or more people could become "bonded" (married essentially) and start families if they wanted to.

# Rules When Using Twindle

The AI that is used in Twindle is very intelligent. Messages that contain any prohibited topics of conversation cannot be sent. Attempting to send such messages will flag the user in the system and a case will be opened. Punishments vary from case to case. 
- Users must remain anonymous.
- Any talk about gender or someone's biological sex is prohibited.
- Candidates are not allowed to meet in person or reveal their identities until they have completed at least a one-year Dating Contract.

# Dating Contracts

When two users want to date or enter a committed relationship, all involved parties must sign a Dating Document. 
This document covers the terms of the relationship. 

Such topics may be covered:
- Exclusivity: Is it an open or exclusive relationship?
- Parenthood: Does the couple plan on becoming parents?
- Any other points the couple feels they need to include in the contract.

If it is found that the users have revealed their identities or broken any other Twindle rule, the contract will be terminated, all parties will be punished, and they will not be allowed to date again.
Failing to meet the agreed-upon Dating Document terms will result in mandatory couple therapy to help remedy the problem. If the issue cannot be resolved, the Dating Document will be terminated and one or more parties involved may face serious punishment. 

# Bonding 
Bonding is when two or more people commit to each other for life. As with dating, a contract is drawn up. Bonding contracts cannot be broken early. If one party breaks the terms of the contract, they are either sent to the "Kiln Center" or put to death.
