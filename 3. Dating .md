# Dating

People are not allowed to just go out and date whomever they please. 
Everyone has the app “Twindle” and it is their only way to have a romantic life. 
The system pairs people with those who it believes they are very compatible with. Then, the user can chat with the selected candidates and they can get to know one another. 

# Rules When Using Twindle

The AI that is used in Twindle is very intelligent. Messages that contain any prohibited topics of conversation cannot be sent. Attempting to send such messages will flag the user in the system and a case will be opened. Punishments vary from case to case. 
- Users must remain anonymous.
- Any talk about gender or someone's biological sex is prohibited.
- Candidates are not allowed to meet in person or reveal their identities until they have completed at least a one-year long Dating Contract.

# Dating Contracts

When two users want to date or enter a commited relationship, all involved parties must sign a Dating Document. 
This document covers the terms of the relationship. 

Such topics may be covered:
- Exclusivity: Is it an open or exclusive relationship?
- Parenthood: Does the couple plan on becoming parents?
- Any other points the couple feels they need to include in the contract.

If it is found that the users have revealed their identities or broken any other Twindle rule, the contract will be terminated, all parties will be punished, and they will not be allowed to date again.
Failing to meet the agreed-upon Dating Document terms will result in mandatory couple therapy to help remedy the problem. If the issue cannot be resolved, the Dating Document will be terminated and one or more parties involved may face serious punishment.
