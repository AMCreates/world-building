# What if...

What if you were teleported into an alternate reality where sexuality had nothing to do with dating? In fact, in this society, sexuality isn’t even a concept. Not a fan? Well, the only way to get back home is to use the app for a year.

# So Imagine…

… that one perfectly sunny day you are lying in bed with your black-out curtains and thick comforter holding you hostage. You get a text from someone you befriended recently. With your corneas screaming from the sudden white screen, you see they sent you a link to download a dating app called “Twindle.” You tap the link and are then enveloped in a pink glow. The next thing you know, you are standing on a sidewalk in an unfamiliar city, and the app is welcoming you to Planet K3. The city you materialize into seems clean, busy, and architecturally stunning. The sky is a pastel blue, the modern buildings are soft and inviting, and there is manically-groomed foliage everywhere. 

The city has a slightly rose-colored tint to it.
